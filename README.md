# blind-maze-dqn

Training a Deep Neural Network to find its way through a maze using Deep Q-Learning.

MazeGenerationKeyInput.py allows for a visualization of what the ANN 'sees' when solving the maze.

mazeDQN.py is the implementation of the standard DQN (including dropout layers) as described in DeepMind's 2015 paper.

mazeDoubleDQN.py is the implementation of the Double DQN as described by Hasselt et al. (2016) extended to use soft target updates.
